        //-                 p The simplest steplist is one that is simply a codelist, much like a direct codelist import. Such a steplist would look like the following:
        //-                 .container.codeContainer
        //-                     p

        //-                 hr
        //-                 h4 Order 
        //-                 p With the presence of exclusion steps, the order in which logic is expressed within a Phenoflow definition is important. Once a patient is excluded, all their subsequent case steps will evaluate to unclassified by default. Consider the following example (which also serves as a general example of a more complex steplist) for AAA:
        //-                 .container.codeContainer 
        //-                     p 
        //-                     code.code logicType,param

        //-                     code.code age,40:90
        //-                     br
        //-                     code.code codelist,abdominal-aortic-aneurysm_cpt.csv:1

        //-                     code.code codelist,abdominal-aortic-aneurysm_icdB.csv:2
        //-                     p 
        //-                 br
        //-                 p Here, any patients that fall outside the age range will be instantly excluded. However, patients with codes from <code class="code">abdominal-aortic-aneurysm_cpt </code> and  <code class="code">abdominal-aortic-aneurysm_icdA</code> will still be flagged as cases, even if later excluded due to the last encounter logic. In this way, we are able to represent different case types, with certain exclusions only applying to certain case types.

        //-                 p The phenotypes represented using the Phenoflow model typically consist of a single branch, where the disjunction relationship between steps means that if any of the steps indicate that a patient is a case (subject to no prior exclusions) they are considered to have the condition being modelled. However, more complex definitions may contain multiple branches.
        //-                 br
        //-                 p As discussed in the model overview, branches are flattened into individual steps within the Phenoflow model. To demonstrate this visually, we can consider the following abstract definition:
        //-                 container.centerContainer
        //-                     img(src="/phenoflow/images/StepBranch1.png" class="box").APIimg
        //-                 br
        //-                 p Here, a patient with codes from lists A, B and D is a case, and a patient without any codes from list A and with codes from list C is also a case. Within the Phenoflow model, this logic is represented as follows: 
        //-                 container.centerContainer
        //-                     img(src="/phenoflow/images/StepBranch2.png" class="box").APIimg
        //-                 br
        //-                 p Here, two steps summarise each branch (joined by a traditional disjunction relationship, which is also true of the relationship between branches), and each condition within the branch must be true in order for that step to resolve, overall, to a 'CASE' value. This differs from the traditional disjunction relationship between steps.

                        p - If the primary logic of a definition is to identify one or more codes from one or more codelists, these lists can be submitted directly to the Phenoflow library, which will further segment the codes in each list into logical groups (each of which is represented by an individual step) to increase intelligibility. 
                        p - If any steps identify a patient as being a case (i.e. the patient has one of the codes it stores), then we consider the patient to have the condition, i.e. there is a disjunction relationship between steps. 
                        p - The library expects the codes in each list to all belong to the same coding system and expects this system to be indicated in the filename using the following naming convention: <code class="code"> phenotype-name_system </code>(e.g. <code class ="code"> abdominal-aortic-aneurysm_icd </code>).
                        p - The content of the codelists themselves can vary; Phenoflow supports a variety of common ways to structure codelists, broadly with a column containing the codes themselves, and a description column providing more detail on each code.
                        p - Once in the correct format, codelists should be compressed and submitted as a zipped folder to the importCodelists endpoint, along with other information about the definition.

                        p The simplest steplist is one that is simply a codelist, much like a direct codelist import. Such a steplist would look like the following:
                        .container.codeContainer
                            p
                            code.code logicType,param

                        h4 Order 
                        p With the presence of exclusion steps, the order in which logic is expressed within a Phenoflow definition is important. Once a patient is excluded, all their subsequent case steps will evaluate to unclassified by default. Consider the following example (which also serves as a general example of a more complex steplist) for AAA:
                        .container.codeContainer 
                            p

                            code.code age,40:90

                        p Here, any patients that fall outside the age range will be instantly excluded. However, patients with codes from <code class="code">abdominal-aortic-aneurysm_cpt </code> and  <code class="code">abdominal-aortic-aneurysm_icdA</code> will still be flagged as cases, even if later excluded due to the last encounter logic. In this way, we are able to represent different case types, with certain exclusions only applying to certain case types.

                        p The phenotypes represented using the Phenoflow model typically consist of a single branch, where the disjunction relationship between steps means that if any of the steps indicate that a patient is a case (subject to no prior exclusions) they are considered to have the condition being modelled. However, more complex definitions may contain multiple branches.
                        br
                        p As discussed in the model overview, branches are flattened into individual steps within the Phenoflow model. To demonstrate this visually, we can consider the following abstract definition:
                        container.centerContainer
                            img(src="/phenoflow/images/StepBranch1.png" class="box").APIimg
                        br
                        p Here, a patient with codes from lists A, B and D is a case, and a patient without any codes from list A and with codes from list C is also a case. Within the Phenoflow model, this logic is represented as follows: 
                        container.centerContainer
                            img(src="/phenoflow/images/StepBranch2.png" class="box").APIimg
                        br
                        p Here, two steps summarise each branch (joined by a traditional disjunction relationship, which is also true of the relationship between branches), and each condition within the branch must be true in order for that step to resolve, overall, to a 'CASE' value. This differs from the traditional disjunction relationship between steps.

                        p To import a definition with branches into Phenoflow, each branch is represented as a steplist, with these lists referenced in a parent steplist.
                        br
                        p For example, to represent the left-most branch of the definition above, a file called <code class="code"> branchA.csv</code class="code"> might look like the following
                        .container.codeContainer

                        p And, to represent the right-most branch, a file called <code class="code"> branchB.csv </code> might look like the following:

                        p To upload a definition to Phenoflow that contains branches, the parent steplist should be collected along with a zipped folder containing any codelists referenced from the parent steplist as well as any branch CSVs, and the codelists they reference. These should all be submitted to the importSteplist endpoint, along with relevant details of the definition.
